## Description

This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming in Java to model vehicle manufacturing. It includes the following classes:

- Engine: A superclass representing different types of engines.
- CombustionEngine, ElectricEngine, and HybridEngine: Subclasses of Engine representing specific engine types.
- Manufacture: A class representing a vehicle manufacturer.
- Vehicle: An abstract superclass representing different types of vehicles.
- ICEV, BEV, and HybridV: Subclasses of Vehicle representing specific vehicle types.

The project showcases the use of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in the context of vehicle manufacturing. Each vehicle has a manufacturer and an engine, and the ShowCharacteristics() method is used to display the specific characteristics of each vehicle.
